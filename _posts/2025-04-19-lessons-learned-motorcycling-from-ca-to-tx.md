A few tips and tricks for my next, long motorcyle trip.

## Notes

{: .note}
Of course, all of this is optional: in the end, the most fun rides are [the least practical ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-WgGh9lvx4): e.g., crunched over for >5 hours on a V4S, scorching heat, on your way to Yosemite!

### The weather

 - Getting rain protection right is important
 - Need waterproof shoes
 - Upper body protection tends to be fine with a leather jacket
 - Covering pants with protective layer?
    + Unfortunately, typically not long enough to cover shoes when your knees are bent over. Water seeps in.
 - Worst case, you can use hotel / motel's hairdryer to dry everything. 
    + But it will take an hour or two.
 - Temperatures can drop from 66F to 36F within 2 hours of riding
	- e.g., Bakersfield (hot) to Lake Isabella (blizzard) to Barstow (normal)
	- Heated jacket liner: good! Stop, take jacket off, put liner on, put jacket back on!
    - Underpants: bad. They require a changing room (or exhibitionism).
    - Overpants: better. But can be clumsy. Or they may be good for warmth but bad for rain. Or good for rain but bad for warmth.
 - Crucial to stay warm
	- Being cold on the bike will mess with your posture.
 	+ You may crunch over which may make other parts of your body cold (e.g., lower back)
    - You may be in pain
 - Wear a tank top underneath for more protection
 - Heated grips don't do much below 44F, or so. 
    + Thicker gloves don't work either, even if the heated grips are on.
    + Need heated gloves for emergency situations.
 - Unclear how to deal with an unplanned winter storm (e.g., 36F weather and light snow)

### Stopping to smell the roses

 - Riding ~250 miles daily from motel to motel is too fast paced
    + You don't really get to enjoy the scenery much because you have to make sure you get there at a reasonable time
    - You don't get to enjoy a morning coffee or an evening dinner anywhere (e.g., Sedona)
    - Ideally, you'd wanna spend an extra day in a place
    - Booking two days in advance also does not seem to lead to good prices
 - Stopping to take pictures should be as painless as possible
    + Ideally, gloves can stay on
    + Ideally, no backpack that you must bring with you
    - Ideally, only heated liner must be unplugged and replugged
 - In general, parking the bike and going for a small bite or a walk is problematic if all valuables are in the bike, especially laptop
    + Need an easily removable laptop & documents pouch
 - Similarly, going for a small hike in a pretty area is hard & discouraging if you have too much gear and/or heavy valuables with you
	+ So maybe leave the drone and the DSLR in the store
 - Having to stop to use phone is annoying
	+ Furthermore, having to take gloves on and off to use phone adds to the annoyance
	+ On the other hand, using the phone while riding is asking for a lot of trouble
 - Configuring Apple's Face ID with the helmet on would be amazing

### Videos

 - Mounting a camera on your bike that you can quickly use to take a picture or a short video is pretty nice
	+ Even a phone for selfies can be sweet
 - GoPro sucks
    + Buttons are hard to use
    + Battery drains super fast
    + 30% battery and it just shuts off
    - Cannot open battery when attached to helmet
    - Opening battery is impossible with fingers; need tool
 - GoPro remote will make some of these better

### Packing

 - Pack such that you can stop at any point and go for a 30 minute walk anywhere.
 - Don't bring anything too valuable
 - Don't bring anything that can't be lost or stolen
 - Don't bring a heavy backpack; you will have to take it with you and will make walking around more miserable.

### Others

 - You need good earplugs for the wind noise
 - You need a smooth ride if you're gonna be on the bike for 5hrs a day
 - You need a windshield: you may have to ride in strong winds for hours
 - BMW R1250GS handlebars are too far forward
 - The airhawk seat cover is pretty solid, but the straps suck.
	+ Plus, there is nothing to cover it with, so you have to pray it doesn't rain. Or, add the seat cover to the list of things you must carry.
