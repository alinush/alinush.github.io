**tl;dr:** Forget univariate. Forget FFTs. Multilinear polynomials are the bomb!

## Preliminaries

### Binary vectors

We often need to go from a number $b \in [0,2^s)$ to its binary representation as a vector $\b\in\binS$, and viceversa:
\begin{align}
\b = [b_0,\ldots,b_{s-1}],\ \text{s.t.}\ b = \sum_{i\in[s)} b_i 2^i
\end{align}

{: .note}
When, clear from context, we switch between the number $b$ and its binary vector representation $\b$.

## Multilinear polynomials

A **multilinear polynomial** $f$ is a polynomial in multiple variables $X_0,X_1,\ldots X_{s-1}$ such that the degree of each variable $X_i \le 1$.
More verbosely, it is a **degree-1 multivariate polynomial in $s$ variables**.

We typically denote all the variables as a vector $\X\bydef(X_0,\ldots,X_{s-1})$.

This means that $f$ can be expressed as:
\begin{align}
f(\X) \bydef \sum_{\b\in\binS} c_\b \prod_{i\in[s)} X_{b_i}
\end{align}

Note that the $c_\b$'s are the polynomial's **coefficients**.

## Lagrange polynomials

We want to define a multilinear polynomial $\eq$ such that that:
\begin{align}
\forall \X,\b\in\binS,
\term{\eq(\X;\b)} &\bydef \begin{cases}
1,\ \text{if}\ \X = \b\\\\\
0,\ \text{if}\ \X \ne \b
\end{cases}\\\\\
\end{align}

How?
\begin{align}
\label{eq:lagrange}
\term{\eq(\X;\b)} &\bydef \prod_{i\in[s)}\left(b_i X_i + (1 - b_i) (1 - X_i)\right)\\\\\
%&\bydef \term{\eq(X_1,\ldots, X_s; b_1,\ldots,b_s)}\\\\\
&\bydef \term{\eq_\b(X_0,\ldots, X_{s-1})},\b\in\binS\\\\\
&\bydef \term{\eq_b(X_0,\ldots, X_{s-1})},b\in[2^s)\\\\\
\end{align}

<!--It is useful to note that:
\begin{align}
\eq_\b(\X) = \eq_\X(\b)
\end{align}-->

{: .note}
We use $b\in[2^s)$ and $\b\in\binS$ interchangeably, when clear from context.
We mostly use $\eq_b(\X)$ and do not explicitly include the number of variables $s$, which is clear from context.

<em>ðŸ‘‡ Why does this work? ðŸ‘‡</em>
</summary>
Try and evaluate $\eq(X;\b)$ at $\X = \b$ by evaluating each product term $b_i X_i + (1-b_i)(1-X_i)$ at $X_i = b_i$!
<br /><br/>

It would yield $b_i^2 + (1-b_i)^2$, which is always equal to 1 for $b_i\in\{0,1\}$.
So all product terms are 1 when $\X=\b$.
<br /><br/>

Next, try to evaluate at $X=\b'$ when $\b'\ne\b$.
In this case, there will be an index $i\in [s)$ such that $b'_i \ne b_i \Rightarrow b_i' = (1-b_i)$.
So, evaluating the $i$th product term at $(1-b_i)$ yields $b_i(1-b_i) + (1-b_i)(1-(1-b_i)) = b_i(1-b_i)+(1-b_i)b_i=2b_i(1-b_i)$ which is always 0.
Therefore, the product is zero when $\X\ne \b$.

### Computing all Lagrange evaluations fast

In many MLE-based protocols (e.g., [sumchecks](/sumcheck) or PCSs like [Hyrax](/hyrax) or [KZH](/kzh)), it is often necessary to **efficiently** compute all $n=2^\ell$ evaluations $(\eq(\x, \i))_{\i\in\\{0,1\\}^\ell}$ of the Lagrange polynomials for an arbitrary point $\x\in\F^\ell$!

This can be done in $2n$ $\F$ multiplications using a tree-based algorithm, best illustrated with an example (for $\ell = 3$):
```
                               1                                 <-- level 0
                         /           \
                      /                 \    
                   /                       \  
                /                             \
           (1 - x_0)                          x_0                <-- level 1
        /             \                 /             \
   (1 - x_1)          x_1          (1 - x_1)          x_1        <-- level 2
    /     \         /     \         /     \         /     \          (4 muls)
(1-x_2)   x_2   (1-x_2)   x_2   (1-x_2)   x_2   (1-x_2)   x_2    <-- level 3
   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |         (8 muls)
   |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
eq_0(x) eq_1(x) eq_2(x) eq_3(x) eq_4(x) eq_5(x) eq_6(x) eq_7(x)  <-- results
```

The algorithm works in two phases:
 - **Phase 1:** Compute all negations $(1-x_k),\forall k\in[\ell)$ in $\ell=\log_2{n}$ field additions
    + **Q**: I wonder whether the negation here is problematic, performance-wise? Would $(x_k - 1)$ help a lot here?
    + We will be ignoring this small cost.
 - **Phase 2:** At every level $k\in[2,\ell]$ in the tree, multiply each node with its parent and overwrite that node with the result.
    + This way, each leaf will have the desired value!
        + For example, the $\eq_0(\x)$ leaf will be set to its actual $(1-x_0)(1-x_1)(1-x_2)$ value.
    + This will result in $2^k$ field multiplications for each level $k$

In general, for $n=2^\ell$, the number of field multiplications can be upper bounded by $T(n) = T(n/2) + n = 2n-1$.
But since we are skipping the $2$ multiplications at level 1 and the $1$ multiplication at level 0, it is really $2n-4$.

e.g., for $n=8$, it is $2 \cdot 8 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12$

However, let's not split hairs and call it $2n$ $\F$ multiplications!

## Multilinear extensions (MLEs)

Given a **vector** $\vect{V} = (V_0, \ldots V_{n-1})$, where $n = 2^\ell$, it can be represented as a multilinear polynomial with $\ell$ variables by interpolation via the Lagrange polynomials from above:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:mle}
\tilde{V}(\X) \bydef \sum_{i\in [n)} V_i \cdot \eq_i(\X)
\end{align}
This way, if $\i=[i_0,\ldots,i_{s-1}]$ is the binary representation of $i$, we have:
\begin{align}
\tilde{V}(\i) = V_i,\forall i \in [n)
\end{align}

{: .definition}
$f$ is often called the **multilinear extension (MLE)** of $\vect{V}$.

{: .note}
Using the [time complexities from above](#computing-all-lagrange-evaluations-fast), notice that evaluating a size-$n$ MLE $f$ at an arbitrary point $(\x,\y)$ will involve (1) $2n$ $\F$ multiplications to compute all the $\eq_i(\x)$ evaluations and (2) $n$ $\F$ multiplications and $n$ $\F$ additions to compute Eq. \ref{eq:mle}.
The total time will be $3n$ $\F$ multiplications and $n$ $\F$ additions.

{: .todo}
Contrast this with evaluating polynomials in [Lagrange basis](/lagrange-interpolation) using the efficient formulas over root of unity?

## Conclusion and acknowledgements

Big thanks to [Ron Rothblum](https://csaws.cs.technion.ac.il/~rothblum/) for pointing out several optimizations that are possible (which I am looking into and will integrate here):

1. For computing all $n=2^\ell$ Lagrange $\eq(\x,\i)_{\i\in\\{0,1\\}^\ell}$ evaluations for an arbitrary $\x\in \F^\ell$, Proposition 1 of [Roth24e][^Roth24e] gives a faster algorithm: $n$ instead of $2n$ $\F$ multiplications! ðŸ¤”
    + Also, it gives a way to stream the computation (but, AFAICT, so does a careful walk through the tree depicted above) 
2. The faster algorithm from above would immediately reduce the MLE evaluation time from $3n$ $\F$ muls to $2n$, but Remark 1 from [ARR25e][^ARR25e] can further reduce this to $n$! ðŸ¤¯
