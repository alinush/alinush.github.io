**tl;dr:** Confidential assets are in town! But first, a moment of silence for [veiled coins](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/pull/3444).

## Preliminaries

We assume familiarity with:

 - [Public-key encryption](/encryption)
    + In particular, [ElGamal](/elgamal)
 - ZK range proofs (e.g., [DeKART](/dekart))
 - [$\Sigma$-protocols](/sigma)

## Construction

### Chunk sizes

We chose 16-bit chunks to ensure that the max pending balance chunks never exceed $2^{32}$ after around $2^{16}$ incoming transfers.
This, in turn, ensures fast decryption times.

Why so many incoming transfers?
There could be use cases, such as payment processors, where seamlessly receiving many transfers is necessary.

## Appendix

### BL DL benchmarks for Ristretto255

These were run on a Macbook M3.

|----------------+------------------------+-------------+--------------+--------------+
| Chunk size     | Algorithm              | Lowest time | Average time | Highest time |
|----------------|------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| 16-bit         | Bernstein-Lange[^BL12] | 1.67 ms     | 2.01 ms      | 2.96 ms      |
| 32-bit         | Bernstein-Lange[^BL12] | 7.38 ms     | 30.86 ms     | 77.00 ms     |
| 48-bit         | Bernstein-Lange[^BL12] | 0.72 s      | 4.03 s       | 12.78 s      |
|----------------+------------------------+-------------+--------------+--------------|

{: .warning}
Something is off here: BL should be faster than baby-step giant-step (BSGS), which would take $2^{16}$ group operations for a 32-bit DL $\Rightarrow$ 0.5 microseconds $2^{16} \approx 32$ ms.
