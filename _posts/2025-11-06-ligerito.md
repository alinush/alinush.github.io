**tl;dr:** Ligero + `<?>` = Ligerito!

## Implementations

There is an initial [Julia implementation](https://github.com/bcc-research/Ligerito.jl), by Bane Capital Crypto.

[Rust implementation](https://github.com/ashutosh1206/ligerito-rust), by Ashutosh Ahelleya.

None of them are as succinct as they can be, apparently.

For $2^{20}$-sized polynomial, the Rust code gives:
```
Prover time:       4.34s
Verifier time:  317.90ms
```
Julia [seems to give](https://x.com/GuilleAngeris/status/1986515713306075285):
```
Prover time:    0.114s
Verifier time:  19ms
```
Andrija says [it should be 2ms](https://x.com/AndrijaNovakov6/status/1986516303524360305).
