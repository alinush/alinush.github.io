### The "official statement"

<!-- ![](/pictures/tbow-th.jpg){: .align-right} -->

I was born and raised in [Pitești](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitesti), a small city in Romania, and moved to the US in 2008.
I was always fascinated with computers: playing on them, fixing them & programming them.
I like to read and write.
In fact, you can see some of my writing on [this website](/archive.html) and on [Decentralized Thoughts](https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/about-alin).

I am currently the _Head of Cryptography_ at [Aptos Labs](https://aptoslabs.com).
My broad [research interests](/papers.html) are in cryptography and its practical applications.
My current interests are around:
 1. general-purpose and/or appliction-specific zero-knowledge proofs
 1. authenticated data structures, especially if based on more exotic primitives, such as [constant-sized polynomial commitments](/2020/05/06/kzg-polynomial-commitments.html).
 1. anonymous payments
 1. publicly-verifiable secret sharing

In the past, I've led research on:
 1. [anonymous cryptocurrencies](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/452)
 1. [tree-based vector commitments](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22fall_srinivasan.pdf)
 1. [constant-sized vector commitments](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-57990-6_3)
 1. [threshold cryptography](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2020/349700b367/1j2LgjE3Q6Q)
 1. [Verkle trees](https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/materials/2019/conf/12-5-Kuszmaul.pdf)
 1. [transparency logs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3319535.3345652)
 1. [append-only logs on top of Bitcoin](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3319535.3345652)
 1. [keyless blockchain accounts](/2024/06/13/Keyless-blockchain-accounts-on-Aptos.html)
 1. zero-knowledge range proofs
 1. publicly-verifiable secret sharing

I've also helped with, but not led, research on 
 - [aggregatable distributed key generation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-77870-5_6)
 - [share recovery for verifiable secret sharing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3319535.3354207)
 - [scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) protocols](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8809541)
 - [oblivious file systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2382196.2382299)

Before joining Aptos Labs, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher and then a Research Scientist at VMware Research.
Before VMware, I was a PhD student at MIT, becoming an applied cryptography researcher with [Srini Devadas](https://people.csail.mit.edu/devadas/), my advisor.
Before joining MIT, I was building tamper-proof clouds and end-to-end encrypted outsourced file storage at [Private Machines](https://privatemachines.com/).

### The _truth_

Alin is a prolific slav-squatter.
In his free time, he likes to play piano, ride motorcycles to coffee shops, and lift things up and put them back down again.
Slowly.
He also enjoys travelling, but only to destinations with total solar eclipses.
Naturally, he dislikes clouds.
(Please join him <strike>in Antarctica, in 2021; or, in Winnemucca, Nevada on October 14th, 2023</strike> in Austin, Texas, on April 8th, 2024.)

### The motorcycle(s)

<strike><b>Alin might buy a motorcycle and risk the few, still-functioning limbs in his body.
Someone should convince him not to do this.</b></strike>

In July 2020, Alin purchased a [2017 Honda Rebel 500](/pictures/rebel-500.jpg).
He has never been more happy and frightened at the same time.
Even after taking basic, intermediate and advanced riding clinics, he remains terrified.
This is probably for the best.
Wish him luck.

_Update (October 2021 - March 2022):_ Since July 2020, Alin continues to have all his limbs.
Encouraged by these developments, Alin has bought a [2019 BMW R1250GS](/pictures/r1250gs-just-bought.jpg) and traded-in his Rebel 500 for a brand new [2022 Honda Rebel 1100 DCT](/pictures/rebel-1100-jjlake.jpg).
He is clearly disturbed.
Someone please help him.

_Update (March 2022 - December 2024):_ Since March 2022, Alin remains in one piece.
Inspired by this turn of events, Alin has bought a [2024 Ducati Panigale V4S](/pictures/panigale-v4s.jpg).
At the time, the main thought going through his head was:

 > _"A good death is its own reward."_

Please pray for him.
(The Rebel 1100 and R1250GS have since been sold.)

<!--
To deal with his predisposition towards death, Alin has been doing several things:

 1. Taking motorcycle courses:
    * In June 2020, he passed the Motorcycle Safety Foundation's Basic Rider Course
    - In Novemeber 2020, he passed Total Control Training's Intermediate Riding Clinic
 2. Practicing deliberately, carefully increasing his area of competence.
 2. Watching [after-crash reviews by "Dan Dan The Fireman"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkRV5Q4sb8c&ab_channel=DanDanTheFireman), to learn from others' mistakes.
    - **WARNING:** Watching such videos before you take a motorcycle safety course can be terrifying and will likely prevent you from ever getting on a motorcycle. 
    - Most of the accidents in the video are caused by the motorcyclist's inability to **take responsibility** for their own safety.
    - That personal responsibility is taught in rider courses (such as the ones above) and by other motorcyclists.
    - At the same time, one must recognize that no amount of personal responsibility will make motorcycles (or cars) completely safe.
